#CHIP TYPES
50K --> 54,610 SNPs --> 128 individuals
GP3v02 --> 26,146 --> 15 individuals 
GP4v01 --> 30,106 --> 33 individuals
GGPv03 --> 26,152 --> 105
GGPHD --> 76,884 --> 31 individuals
GGP --> 19,721 --> 6 individuals

#CREATING COMBINED PED FILES
1. FinalReport + SNPMap (AB allele) Illumina to ped and map files 	##/home/janao/Genotipi/Genotipi1_12042016/Raw_to_Ped.sh
2. combine genotyping packages (directories) from the same chip 	##
3. create a list of ped & map files from the same chip (different directories)	##MapPed files in /home/janao/Genotipi/Genotipi1_12042016/
4. use PLINK merge (and --recode) option to merge all the ped and map files from the same chip ##PLINK_combined_Ped.sh in /home/janao/Genotipi/Genotipi1_12042016/
	#problem with GGPv03 chhip --> map file, Dominant_Red line
	#problem with GGPv03 package --> less SNPs in map file then ped files
5. created files in /home/janao/Genotipi/Genotipi1_12042016/Combined_AB:
	#Ped50K
	#PedGP3v02
	#PedGP4v01
	#PedHD
6. create PED files by chromosome ##Ped_by_chr.sh in /home/janao/Genotipi/Genotipi1_12042016/Combined_AB
	create directories for each chip and put chromosome ped and map files in there
7. convert ped and map file to .bgl file (one for each chromosome, unphased) AND run imputation step with reference phased .bgl file 
(txt file in /home/janao/Genotipi/MS_impute_phased_Ref+Marker_files/pAll*) and marker file (.txt file in /home/janao/Genotipi/MS_impute_phased_Ref+Marker_files
/Min*) with Minimum SNP set (880 markers) ##PedToBgl_byChr.sh in /home/janao/Genotipi/Genotipi1_12042016/Combined_AB
8. mkdir within each chip directory called Beagle_phased and gunzip phased bgl files
9. extract MS from all individuals and compare with what is in the table GOVEDO.ZIVALI_GP --> MS data
